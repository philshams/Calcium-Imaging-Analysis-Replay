Refactoring of TwoPhotonPipeline
================================

Typical pipeline
----------------

1. read in data, 2 formats
   - stack of Tiff files
   - raw format
   /!\ unify inputs

2. registration (align images)
   /!\ avoid copy images, just save delta (x, y)
   /!\ do it while loading
   /!\ GUI to select/remove frames containing out-of-focus cells
       and/or indicator of this phenomenon

3. ROI definition
   - several algorithms
   - from manual to semi-automatic
   - need nice GUI to (un-)select cells
   - issues with surrounding activity, dendrites passing... should not included
     in ROI of a cell
  /!\ GUI to help viewing images and selecting/correcting ROIs, highlight
      possible problems with surrounding activity of a cell

4. timeseries extraction


Particular issues
-----------------

code exists (TwoPhotonPipeline stack + personal flavors ?)
=> assemble and tidy more than rewrite

data should be copy once from drive to local computer (not back and forth)
=> hide it in a class which locally cache the data from drive ?

avoid loading everything in memory
=> - reuse Dylan code from TiffStack to lazily load frame into memory
   - re-design critical methods to work online ?


People involved
---------------

- Peter knows best the code of TwoPhotonPipeline
- Flore (leaving soon) knows the code also
- Ioanna
- Ivanna
- Kelly (in the future)
- Ivan (in the future)

- Dylan and Morgane have their own stuff, unlikely to change to this code but
  may have interesting ideas ?


First steps
-----------

- 1st meeting: 6 people, agree on core functionalities
- 2nd meeting: everyone, to get comments
