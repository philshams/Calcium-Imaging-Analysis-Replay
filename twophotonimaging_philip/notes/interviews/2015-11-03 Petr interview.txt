Petr interview - TwoPhotonPipeline demo
=======================================

Experimental setup
------------------

- 4 machines
  + imaging machine: use ScanImage (Matlab) to get images
    => TIFF images + grab file (.mat file, specific to ScanImage)
  + stimulus machaine: triggered by imaging machine
    => use of Psycho(physics ?) Matlab toolbox, .mat files output
  + eyecam machine
    => receive mirror position signal from hardware
       record pupils
       send -- numerical -- heartbeats to VR machine
  + VR (virtual reality) machine
    => get and save signal from wheel
       get -- numerical -- heartbeats from eyecam machine
       display VR with unity (if used, but not by Petr)


TwoPhotonPipeline tour
----------------------

/!\ this package override some Matlab functions ! really bad practice

- GuiAddToStackList
  + need file path of ImageData/RawData and save it
    but it's not used by next step :S
  + add StackID to folder name
    create ini file
    modify excel file in ExpLog
    modify grab file

- paths defined in "define_path_bioz" function
  => gives paths on machine, for each user

- poi library needed on Linux to load/save excel in Linux

- GuiRunAnalysisList
  + select experiment
    => find trials (stacks) but don't use paths saved in excel file, use
       convention on folder names !
  + checkboxes in lower panel are useless
    clear remove all selected stacks
    operations applied in all visible stacks in the lower panel

- registration (in GuiRunAnalysisList)
  + in Petr version, stacks copy locally and shifts copied back to server
  + resulting .mat file (in AData server folder) used to add infos of following
    steps
  + ProcessedData folder now contains empty stacks (but still create it)
    => before the registered data where copied their

- ROI
  + Petr uses only donut (semi-automatic)
  + first one reference stack is selected from all stacks in an experiment
    => from average images
  + /!\ if no PCA/ICA step computed, no results saved
  + morphological method should be run before adding a cell (create structure
    where to put resulting ROIs)
  + cannot reload previous ROI
  + PCA/ICA working super good for Petr
  + select an ROI (difficult to click on it :S) to edit it
  + results of this Gui in a "bwsel" variable
    => just a mask, labels lost, use of matlab with component labelling after
       to get it back

- ROI sh
  => no Gui, use ROI from the reference stack and align it for other
     experiments

- act
  + extract activity (average or weighted sum ?)
  + infer spikes, but time consuming (more than recording)

- vol
  => kind of repeat_checker (cf. ROI Gui) but useless now that this latter
     exists

- ch2 => ask Florencia

- Stim
  => find right stim file (using date) and add its path to AData .mat file
