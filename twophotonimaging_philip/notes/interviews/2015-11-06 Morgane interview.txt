Morgane interview - Calliope demo
=================================

- 1 session = 1h. / animal
  1 trial = 10-15 min.

- use Calliope, from FMI group (Keller)
- software base on excel file, use a unique timestamp for each recording
  => same ID for all files, behaviour and images ! really useful
- synchronisation of images and behavioural data
  => tricky in case of problems, with many quick restarts

- first step to group stacks as experiments
  => grouped data for registration and ROIs after (heavy on memory)

- same Gui for ROIs than TwoPhotonPipeline
  -> but can plot activity trace once ROIs done
  -> cluster is about grouping axons buttons
     just display, not save at present time

- workflow separated for images and behavioural data
  => analyzed together at the end
