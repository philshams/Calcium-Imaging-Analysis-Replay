Ioana intervew - TwoPhotonPipeline demo
=======================================

File organisation
-----------------

- ImageData/

    - RawData/ -> raw data sequences
      subfolders (per people then experiences ?), containing
      + .tiff files (sequences, split if two big ?)
      + a grab file (.mat) -> metadata about acquisition

    - StimData/ -> stimulus informations, related but not synced with RawData

    - ExpLog/ -> Excel spreadsheets (one per person ?) making connection
                 between file and StackID/ExpID

    - AData/ -> ROI results
      + 1 .mat per slice file


Grouping recordings
-------------------

- grouping/referencing sequences into ExpLog using "GuiAddToStackList"
  => each recording has a unique StackID
     part of an experiment with a ExpID (= StackID of 1st recording of the set)
     other metadata (projet, experimenter, animal, date...)
  => recording in ExpLog/<pattern with experiment name ?>.xsls
     increment a text file (where ?) keeping count of last used StackID ?

- GuiAddToStackList call "main_InVitro.m"


Analysis
--------

- GuiRunAnalysisList launches gui for analysis
  + not clear what "Clear" button does

- registration
  + seems some computations are re-done even after unchecking the StackID for
    a specific stack (in lower panel)

- ROI selection
  + method selected in personal settings ("myexp/" subdirectory)
  + donut_main (GUI) is semi-automatic method used by Ioana
    * can be used alone
    * radio-button for add/remove/change mask/erode/dilate ?
    * erode/dilate doesn't seem to work with individual masks
      but with "all" it does
  + after 1 slice (Z-axis) is done, automatically switch to the next one
    -> not sure if results are saved if procedure interrupted before all slices
       are processed

- ch2 => handle a second channel (other color)

- stim => sync stimulus info with recordings infos (from StimData)

- for interleaved data (Z-axis), they are separated at some point
  (registration ?) to get several data file


Discussion with Rob
-------------------

- reduce burden on stimulus sync by
  + putting networkless machines (stimulus & co) in a network with a
    network-linked machine (running NTP ?)
  + the network-linked machine could retrieve stimulus directly from stimulus
    machine ?

- setting_handler repo on bitucket:
  solution to handle local settings for matlab code (avoid everyone to edit its
  own myexp/)

- change directory structure to get everything in one place ?
